2015-06-29 13:59:57	freusque	Hello again weechat
2015-06-29 14:00:31	freusque	I have an issue with the weechat android relay. After one hour, the app needs a disconnect/reconnect in order to recieve irc traffic.
2015-06-29 14:00:50	freusque	is there a way to set a timeout to stop this behavior? I know this is a long shot :)
2015-06-29 14:00:56	Yoda	freusque: probably best suited for #weechat-android [i think]
2015-06-29 14:01:06	Yoda	yeah. #weechat-android
2015-06-29 14:01:10	freusque	Yoda: thanks :)
2015-06-29 14:01:17	Yoda	^^

2015-06-29 14:07:07	narendraj9	How can I combine two commands? For example I wan to execute in sequence: /window scroll_beyond_end and /window scroll down.
2015-06-29 14:07:24	frenulum	freusque: I use the app all the time with current weechat and weechat-android versions. no issues at all.
2015-06-29 14:08:54	stfn	narendraj9: for example with /eval, or you can create an /alias

2015-06-29 14:09:35	narendraj9	stfn: Can you give an example?
2015-06-29 14:09:51	stfn	/help eval and /help alias both have examples.
2015-06-29 14:10:11	narendraj9	Say I want to scroll beyond end and then scroll up so that the new messages come at the middle of the screen.
2015-06-29 14:10:53	aftix	How can I change the status bar time to be 12 hour?

2015-06-29 14:12:01	Yoda	narendraj9: to combine the two commands above.. /alias <name> /window scroll_beyond_end;/window scroll down
2015-06-29 14:12:05	Yoda	then you'd execute /<name>
2015-06-29 14:12:18	aftix	thanks stfn
