2018-12-05 21:44:38	aftix	i think dx bannod me
2018-12-05 21:44:42	aftix	banned
2018-12-05 21:45:04	pooby	what why
2018-12-05 21:45:09	aftix	meming
2018-12-05 21:45:23	pooby	yeah that don't belong in there except occasionally
2018-12-05 21:58:19	aftix	the buddylist weechat plugin is broke for me :(
2018-12-05 21:59:10	pooby	uh you don't need it anymore
2018-12-05 21:59:14	pooby	the new weechat doesn't need it
2018-12-05 21:59:21	aftix	what do you do
2018-12-05 21:59:30	pooby	oh wait that's the bufferlist
2018-12-05 21:59:32	pooby	nvm
2018-12-05 21:59:45	aftix	yea bufferlist is default
2018-12-05 21:59:49	aftix	i have mine on topy
2018-12-05 21:59:55	pooby	so, uhh did you turn it on ?
2018-12-05 22:00:01	aftix	yea
2018-12-05 22:00:03	pooby	alt + t
2018-12-05 22:00:10	pooby	or esc + t
2018-12-05 22:00:18	aftix	to turn what on
2018-12-05 22:00:26	pooby	I actually do ctrl + [ then t
2018-12-05 22:00:29	pooby	the buddy list
2018-12-05 22:00:34	pooby	i think that's the default
2018-12-05 22:00:38	pooby	keybinding
2018-12-05 22:01:05	pooby	since I use i3, my alt key is absorbed by window manager
2018-12-05 22:01:13	pooby	so I can't use alt
2018-12-05 22:01:31	pooby	but esc followed by the key is equivalent to alt + key
2018-12-05 22:05:24	aftix	meta-t isn't bound
2018-12-05 22:06:01	pooby	hmm
2018-12-05 22:06:16	pooby	just type /key
2018-12-05 22:06:26	pooby	preferably in your first buffer
2018-12-05 22:06:29	pooby	the 'weechat' one
2018-12-05 22:07:54	pooby	use ctrl-r to search for toggle nicklist
2018-12-05 22:09:26	aftix	meta-n
2018-12-05 22:09:55	pooby	oh yeah that's the default
2018-12-05 22:09:58	pooby	i musta changed it
2018-12-05 22:10:17	pooby	i think i wanted to be able to scroll up with meta n/p
2018-12-05 22:11:26	aftix	what does that have to do with buddylist
2018-12-05 22:15:01	pooby	nothing i just switched the keybindings?
2018-12-05 22:15:03	pooby	not sure
2018-12-05 22:15:08	aftix	buddylist isnt nicklist
2018-12-05 22:15:10	pooby	i can't remember anymore
2018-12-05 22:15:17	pooby	wtf is buddylist
2018-12-05 22:15:20	aftix	im just not going to use it
2018-12-05 22:15:39	aftix	it keeps track of the online status of irc "buddies"
2018-12-05 22:15:47	pooby	that might be another outdated plugin that is not needed with modern weechat
2018-12-05 22:15:50	aftix	it always said everyone was online
2018-12-05 22:16:05	pooby	that sounds like nicklist
2018-12-05 22:16:10	pooby	or you mean it's global
2018-12-05 22:16:14	aftix	global
2018-12-05 22:16:17	pooby	i see
2018-12-05 22:16:21	pooby	yeah that's different
2018-12-05 22:16:26	aftix	like in pidgin
2018-12-05 22:19:33	pooby	never used it
